This is the first Quantum Hackathon by Québec Quantique and QuantX, in partnership with ACET, Centech, Entrepreneuriat ULaval and Quantino!
The event is supported by Institut Quantique, QAI, IBM, Quantonation, Multiverse Computing, Pasqal, AWS, Hydro-Québec, Novacene AI, 1QBit, INTRIQ and QBraid.

The BIG Quantum Hackathon by QuantX, the first of a kind competition, aims to gather the whole value chain of Quantum Computing and demonstrate its ability to address the real life challenges. During the event, the business world represented by industrial and financial companies, venture capital / private equity investors, and consulting groups will join forces with quantum computing specialists from academia, quantum hardware and software providers to approach a set of longstanding problems from different domains: chemistry, machine learning, optimization, numerical simulations, to name a few.

Through establishing a stage for a collaborative problem solving, the BIG Quantum Hackathon will help the participants to investigate the real impact of their work, today’s viability of QC solutions, existing business interest, the priorities, and efforts to be done in the coming years.
